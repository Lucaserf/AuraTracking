A simple Flask web server to track reputation points for users identified by name. Anyone can submit positive or negative updates to a user's score, optionally including a motivation text. The server also provides an endpoint to retrieve a ranked list of users based on their reputation scores.

**Note:** This implementation uses in-memory storage (a Python dictionary). All data will be lost when the server is stopped or restarted. For persistent storage, integrate a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) or file storage.

## Features

*   Assign reputation scores to users by name.
*   Update scores with positive or negative numeric values.
*   Optionally include a string motivation with each update.
*   Retrieve the current score and last motivation for a specific user.
*   Get a ranked list of all users (highest score first).
*   Simple API endpoints for interaction.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   A tool to make HTTP requests (like `curl`, Postman, Insomnia, or a web browser for GET requests).

## Installation

1.  **Save the code:** Ensure you have the server code saved as `app.py` in a directory.
2.  **Navigate to the directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and change to the directory where you saved `app.py`.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/server/directory
    ```
3.  **(Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

## Running the Server

1.  **Start the server:** Run the following command in your terminal from the directory containing `app.py`:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2.  The server will start, typically listening on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You'll see output similar to:
    ```
     * Serving Flask app 'app'
     * Debug mode: on
     * Running on http://192.168.17.51:5000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
     * Restarting with stat
     * Debugger is active!
     * Debugger PIN: ...
    ```

**Note:** The server runs in debug mode by default (`debug=True`), which is helpful for development (automatic reloading on code changes, detailed error pages). For production use, set `debug=False` in `app.run()`.

## API Endpoints

The server exposes the following endpoints:

### 1. Update Reputation

*   **Endpoint:** `POST /reputation/<name>`
*   **Description:** Adds or subtracts points from the specified user's reputation. Creates the user if they don't exist (starting from 0 points).
*   **URL Parameter:**
    *   `<name>`: The name of the user (case-insensitive, stored lowercase).
*   **Request Body (JSON):**
    *   `update` (required): A numeric value (integer or float) representing the points to add (positive) or subtract (negative).
    *   `motivation` (optional): A string describing the reason for the update.
*   **Example Request (`curl`):**
    ```bash
    # Add 10 points to 'alice' with motivation
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"update": 10, "motivation": "Solved a tricky bug"}' \
         http://192.168.17.51:5000/reputation/alice

    # Subtract 3 points from 'bob' (no motivation)
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"update": -3}' \
         http://192.168.17.51:5000/reputation/bob
    ```
*   **Success Response (200 OK):**
    ```json
    // Response for the first example above
    {
      "message": "Reputation updated for 'alice'",
      "name": "alice",
      "new_reputation": 10,
      "motivation_received": "Solved a tricky bug"
    }

    // Response for the second example above
    {
        "message": "Reputation updated for 'bob'",
        "name": "bob",
        "new_reputation": -3
    }
    ```
*   **Error Responses:**
    *   `400 Bad Request`: If the request body is not JSON, missing the `update` key, or if `update` is not a number, or `motivation` is not a string.
    *   `400 Bad Request`: If the `<name>` in the URL is empty.

### 2. Get User Reputation

*   **Endpoint:** `GET /reputation/<name>`
*   **Description:** Retrieves the current reputation score and the last recorded motivation for a specific user.
*   **URL Parameter:**
    *   `<name>`: The name of the user (case-insensitive).
*   **Example Request (`curl`):**
    ```bash
    curl http://192.168.17.51:5000/reputation/alice
    ```
*   **Success Response (200 OK):**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "alice",
      "reputation": 10,
      "last_motivation": "Solved a tricky bug"
    }
    ```
*   **Error Responses:**
    *   `404 Not Found`: If the user with the specified `<name>` does not exist in the system.

### 3. Get Ranking

*   **Endpoint:** `GET /ranking`
*   **Description:** Returns a list of all users, sorted by their reputation score in descending order (highest score first).
*   **Example Request (`curl`):**
    ```bash
    curl http://192.168.17.51:5000/ranking
    ```
*   **Success Response (200 OK):**
    ```json
    [
      {
        "name": "alice",
        "reputation": 10
      },
      {
        "name": "bob",
        "reputation": -3
      }
      // ... other users
    ]
    ```
    *(Note: The list will be empty `[]` if no users have had their reputation updated yet)*

### 4. Clear All Data (For Testing)

*   **Endpoint:** `POST /clear`
*   **Description:** Removes all user reputation data from the server's memory. Use with caution! Intended primarily for testing purposes.
*   **Example Request (`curl`):**
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://192.168.17.51:5000/clear
    ```
*   **Success Response (200 OK):**
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Cleared X reputation entries." // X is the number of entries cleared
    }
    ```

### 5. Home / Health Check

*   **Endpoint:** `GET /`
*   **Description:** A simple endpoint to check if the server is running.
*   **Example Request (`curl`):**
    ```bash
    curl http://192.168.17.51:5000/
    ```
*   **Success Response (200 OK):**
    ```
    Reputation Server is running!
    ```

## Data Persistence

As mentioned, this server uses **in-memory storage**. If the Python script stops for any reason (manual stop, crash, server reboot), **all reputation data will be lost**.

For any serious use case, replace the `reputations = {}` dictionary with a persistent storage solution like:

*   **SQLite:** A simple file-based database, good for single-server applications.
*   **PostgreSQL / MySQL:** More robust relational databases suitable for larger applications.
*   **Redis:** An in-memory data structure store that *can* be configured for persistence, potentially good for caching or simpler datasets.
*   **Files:** Saving the data to JSON or CSV files (requires careful handling of reads/writes).

## Potential Future Enhancements

*   Database integration for persistence.
*   Authentication/Authorization (to control who can update reputations).
*   History of reputation updates for each user.
*   More detailed error handling and logging.
*   Unit and integration tests.
*   Rate limiting to prevent abuse.
*   Dockerization for easier deployment.
